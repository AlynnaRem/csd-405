/* The purpose of this program is to calculate the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. 
This program will prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms, the initial temperature, and the final temperature of the water with the following formula:
Q = waterMass ( finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature ) x 4184
waterMass is water weight in kilograms
finalTemperature and initialTemperature are temperatures in Celsius
Q is the results in Joules */
